February is LGBT History Month and on the last Friday of the month we celebrate Purple Friday - a day to stand against homophobia, biphobia and transphobia and show our support for LGBTI equality.

<!--more-->

To support our LGBTI community, we will be collecting signatures on our Pride flag. Also feel free to wear purple though this is not a requirement.

See you all Friday!
